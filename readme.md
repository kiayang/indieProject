Kia Yang individual Project

### Problem Statement

The Yang Family have a funeral fund hardship contribution membership and the families who join in the contribution are required to contribute $15 person to help with funeral expenses. 

In the past keeping track of family members have been with a word document and with over 400 members it is a little bit hard to keep track of the members in the program.  We have to keep track of things like who died and who is still living as well has payments that have been made. Tallying up the contributions have always been done by hands and sending notifications to members are time consuming. On top of that members are located all over the states and keeping track of all members in the different state is hard and have to be done manually.

As a result I have to build a FamilyHardshipContribution website to do the following:

1. Adding or updating members can be achieved online and by the members
2. Keeping track of members status are easier
3. Have family membership guidelines and rules online so everyone can have access to it in one place.  Updates and adjustment to the guidelines and rules are easier.
6. Automate and balancing contributions automatically by status of who paid and who didnâ€™t pay.
7. Easy reporting of member locations, status and updates
